SeniorProj_BMS_PCA
==================

This is the code repository for Rowan University Fall 2014 Senior Project.

Our team is further developing an Excel add-in that visualizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA).  Two plots have been
chosen to be implemented: scores plot and loadings plot. This project is being developed in conjunction with Bristol-Myers 
Squibb.

The PCA visualization functionality has been implemented in:
- [SeniorProj_BMS_PCA/PCA_Addin/Classes/PCA_graphing.cs](https://github.com/chrismeyers/SeniorProj_BMS_PCA/blob/master/PCA_Addin/Classes/PCA_graphing.cs)
